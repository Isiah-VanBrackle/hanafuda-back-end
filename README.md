# hanafuda-backend

Hanafuda Backend is an API designed to store the data of the 48 cards needed to play HanaFuda. It also handles all of the logic for shuffling the cards, distributing them where they are needed, and calculating the players points based on their end game collection.

# Getting Started
To begin you'll want to clone down both this Backend repository and the Frontend. The instructions below will focus on getting the Backend up and running.  I'd recommend you completely set up the backend first to avoid a "server in use error." Instructions for how to actually play the game are located in the Frontend's readME.

# Installing
1. Open up your text editor's terminal run 'bundle install' our gem-file is up to date so you shouldn't need to install any new gems
2. Run 'rails s' to get the server started
3. A localhost tab should open in your browser explore it to see the json data from our database
4. With the backend up and running you'll be able to log into the application once you install the front end.
